## Trading App

#### Application calculating average value for different intervals (intervals listed in [trading-future-interval.enum.ts](src%2Fapp%2Fshared%2Fmodels%2Ftrading-future-interval.enum.ts))


#### What could be improved

`Keep state of min/max values in localStorage or IndexedBD to make it survide after refreshes`
`Add test coverage for differet scenarios`
`UI improvements :)`
`Maybe create separate module for ` [historical-data-storage.component.ts](src%2Fapp%2Fhistorical-data-storage%2Fhistorical-data-storage.component.ts)


##### One of the main goals was not to use any array or storage 


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
